## Requirements

-   Windows.
-   [OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org) version 3.0 or more recent.
-   [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.4 or more recent will work. 
    However, Python 3.7 or above is highly recommended.
-   Java Runtime Environment (OpenOffice might need it for macro
    execution).

__LibreOffice users:__  _A stand-alone LibreOffice variant not requiring a separate Python installation can be found [here](https://peter88213.github.io/yw-cnv)._

## Download and install

* Download the `.oxt` file (Scroll down this page to _Assets_).
* Install it either by double-clicking or using the OpenOffice extension manager.
* After installation (and Office restart) you find a new "yWriter Import/Export" submenu in the "Files" menu.
* If no additional "yWriter Import/Export" submenu shows up in the "Files" menu, please look at the "Tools" > "Extensions" menu.
