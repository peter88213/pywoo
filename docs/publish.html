<h2>Import and export yWriter projects with Python</h2>

<a href="http://spacejock.com/yWriter7.html">yWriter</a> is a free word processor written by Australian author and programmer Simon Haynes. yWriter's strengths are structuring novels and controlling the progress during the writing process. With this extension you can combine the advantages of yWriter 7 with the advantages of OpenOffice.

<strong>Please note:</strong> This extension is a port of the LibreOffice "yw-cnv" extension written in Python 3. Its code is not compatible with OpenOffice's Python 2.x scripting engine, thus an external Python 3.4 (or more recent) installation is required for execution. You can download it here: https://www.python.org/
